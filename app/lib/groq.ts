Subject: Quick tip to boost conversions on [Their Website Name]

Hey [First Name],

I checked out [Their Website Name] ‚Äî solid idea and direction with [What They Offer].

But I noticed one thing that might be costing you sales:  
üëâ [Specific Issue]  
(Examples:  
‚Äì Your hero section doesn‚Äôt clearly say what problem you solve.  
‚Äì Your CTA blends into the background on mobile.  
‚Äì There‚Äôs no urgency or trust elements like testimonials.)

Fixing that could instantly improve your conversion rate.

I run a landing page agency called Revlane. We specialize in turning good pages into high-converting ones that actually sell.

If you‚Äôre open to it, I‚Äôd love to show you what we‚Äôd improve on your site ‚Äî free of charge. Just reply ‚Äúyes‚Äù and I‚Äôll send over a quick audit.

Best,  
Aymen
